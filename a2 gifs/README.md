## Describe each of the four GIFs 
Starry Night resembles the night sky in the country side. It is sped up showing the fascinating stars and galaxies.
Tiger Eye shows the eye of a tiger. It is futuristic yet menacing.
War is a bleak representation of the battlefield. Camouflage gets filled with blood.
The last one is fireworks, an infinite loop of joy.
## What P5 method or technique did you enjoy using the most? What was interesting to you about it?

I really liked the noise feature because of its unpredictibility. Everytime I combined it with another screen, it changed it so much.
## Did you find any P5 functionality that wasn't covered in class?
 
No
## How did you get your looping gif to loop smoothly? What was hard or easy about that techinque?
 
I made sure it went slowly and used sin and cos so it is looping internally rather than thinking about all the scenarios.
